== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin available in other languages? =

Not yet. Currently it's only available in English. However, the plugin is ready to be translated. It includes the Portable Object Template (.POT) file needed to make translations. If you would like to translate the plugin into another language, please do so. You may send the translation files to support@digitalwindfire.com and I'll include them in the next release. Thank you for your assistance.

= Can I reset the default global settings? =

Yes. Normally, settings are preserved when the plugin is disabled and only removed when the plugin is uninstalled. To reset the defaults, change the value of the `Preserve Settings` option to false in the plugin's main menu. Then deactivate the plugin. Finally activate the plugin again. Default settings are restored.
